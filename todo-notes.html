Whole Wheat bread
The bread is dense -> Why?
whole wheat bread is dense because the bran cuts gluten strands, hindering rise, combined with factors like:
not enough liquid/gluten, insufficient kneading/proofing, too much flour, old yeast, or using chlorinated water, all preventing the dough from trapping enough gas for a light, airy crumb.
Adding white flour, vital wheat gluten, or letting the dough rest (autolyse) can significantly improve texture. 



Main Issues:
Bran interference: The sharp bran in whole wheat flour slices through gluten, making it hard to form a strong, stretchy network.
Not enough gluten: Whole wheat has less gluten than white flour, so you need to supplement it.
Too much flour: Whole wheat absorbs more liquid; adding too much flour during kneading makes it dry and dense. 



Fluffy bread has a strong gluten network, higher hydration, proper kneading, and sufficient proofing to trap air,
while dense bread often has less gluten development, lower water, rushed rising, or too much flour, creating a tighter crumb.
Key factors are hydration (more water = fluffier), kneading (builds gluten structure), proofing (right time for yeast activity),
flour type (bread flour for more gluten), and ingredients like fat/sugar (which add softness). 





DRAFT

Many people dread the idea of having to use whole wheat flour, but when made the right way, whole wheat bread can be the preferred option, due to it's nice, nutty flavor, which pairs well with honey and savory spreads.

The biggest issue with whole wheat bread is its texture, which is usually denser, dryer, and less airy than white bread.

Soft, airy, fluffy bread relies on three main criteria: a strong gluten network, high hydration, and sufficient proofing to trap air.

Every single one of those criteria is interrupted when you switch to whole wheat bread, meaning if you don't adjust your recipe the bread will be dry, dense, and not very appetizing.

Whole wheat bread is often less soft, airy, and fluffy due to the bran interfering with gluten network, the bran and germ absorbing more water, and due to a weak gluten network, it's harder for the bread to trap air.
As you can see, virtually every criteria for soft bread is interrupted, but this recipe helps you fix that so you can achieve whole wheat bread that is close to the softness of white bread.



INGREDIENTS

- 
Milk: The fats in milk help soften and add moisture to the bread
Water: Adds extra hydration
Yeast: To help the dough rise and create air pockets
Egg: Adds richness and moisture
Honey: Adds sweetness and moisture
Olive Oil: Adds fat for moisture
Salt: Salt is crucial for whole wheat bread (and all yeast breads) as it controls yeast, strengthens gluten for better rise/texture, enhances flavor, and acts as a preservative; without it, the dough is weak, sticky, over-proofs, and the bread tastes bland, while too much makes it dense and salty. It doesn't "interfere" negatively in normal amounts (around 2% of flour weight)
Flour: I use King Arthur's golden wheat, which is their milder option (the other option is red wheat, which is less neutral)




TECHNIQUE

Step 1: Autolyse: Mix the flour and hot water (not hot enough to cook the flour), let it sit for 30 mins to 1 hour
This allows gluten to start forming before bran interferes. Autolyse also helps soften bran by allowing water to fully hydrate it, which makes the bran less sharp and abrasive,
reducing its tendency to cut gluten strands and leading to a more tender, airy whole grain bread. 
The longer you let it sit, the better, so aim for the 1 hour.
This is called Autolyse/Hydration.
Autolyse (auto-lease) in baking is the method of mixing just flour and water and letting it rest before adding other ingredients like salt and starter,
allowing flour to fully hydrate and enzymes to start gluten development, resulting in stronger, easier-to-handle dough, better flavor, and reduced kneading time,
especially beneficial for whole grains. It's a simple resting period, typically 30 minutes to several hours, that significantly improves dough structure and texture

Step 2: Proof the Yeast: After autolyse, in a bowl add warm milk (to 100 F), yeast, and honey.
Make sure the top of the milk foams so you know the yeast is active.

Step 3: To the same bowl of milk, add egg, olive oil, salt (2% of flour weight). Mix well.

Step 4: Add the ingredients to the soaked flour and gently knead or mix with dough hook attachment on low until uniform.
The dough should be very sticky and stick to your hands, after you let it rest, it will be less sticky after it absorbs more liquid.


Gentle mix/knead/fold 


After you've mixed the dough together the first time, it should be so sticky you can barely handle it, but don't fret. Just let the dough rest and absorb some water, then knead more and then rest again. 
Add yest and water mixture the second knead.
The bread should stick to your hands right after you mix it, and after letting it sit, then come back and knead it.
