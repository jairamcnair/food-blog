<intro>Welcome to Blissful Eats!</intro>
<p>
    This blog was originally created as a way to keep our family recipes organized and easy to find (beats digging through a binder!). Luckily, in the process, we get to share them with you too!
</p>


<h2>Our Recipes</h2>
<p>
    Our recipes focus on minimally-processed ingredients, meaning all of our recipes use ingredients with little-to-no preservatives, fillers, or other additives. Due to this, most of our recipes are from scratch or use ingredients that are comletely homemade.
</p>
<p>
    Our recipe serving sizes take small households into account, with the smallest serving size usually being enough to serve 1-2 people.
